# SRGAN-Low-dose-CT-Scan-Denoising
Low-dose CT Scan Image denoising/super-resolution through deep learning-based Generative adversarial networks (GANs) specifically SRGAN. This project uses a deep learning-based SRGAN model to remove noise from low-dose CT Scans and upscale 16x16 CT Scans by a 4x factor. The resulting 64x64 images display sharp features that are plausible based on the dataset that was used to train the neural net.
Here's a random, example of what this network can do. From left to right, the first column is the ground-truth input image with very low noise (Normal Dose Image), the second one is a low dose image with much more Gaussian and Poisson noise (Heavily downsampled), the third is the output generated by the neural net.

As you can see, the network is able to produce a very plausible reconstruction of the ground truth images.
